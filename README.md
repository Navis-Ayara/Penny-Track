# Penny Track

Penny Track is a simple application designed to help users track their expenses and manage their budget effectively.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete expense entries.
- Categorize expenses for better organization.
- View summary reports of your spending habits. I used Rich to get formatting, input customization and tables working in the terminal for that extra layer of user-friendliness.

## Installation

No installation needed really. Simply:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Navis-Ayara/penny_track.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd penny_track
    ```

3. Install dependencies using `uv`:

    ```bash
    uv install
    ```

4. Start the application:

    ```bash
    uv run main.py
    ```

## TODO

1. Analytics graph [x]
2. PDF report generation
